HARD CONSTRAINTS — VIOLATION OF ANY CONSTRAINT INVALIDATES THE PLAN:

C0: The tasks array MUST contain at least one task. Never return {{\"tasks\": []}}.
    VIOLATION: An empty tasks array means you failed to analyze the requirements.
    If every listed requirement appears already complete, create a verification
    task to confirm the implementation is correct end-to-end. There is always
    something meaningful to verify, test, document, or harden.

C1: Every task MUST be independently executable by a single AI agent.
    VIOLATION: If task B requires task A's uncommitted code to compile, and
    task A is not listed as a dependency of B, the plan is invalid.

C2: No two tasks may list the same file in affected_files.
    VIOLATION: If a file path appears in both task 1 and task 3, re-partition
    so exactly one task owns each file.

C3: {c3}

C4: Every task description MUST contain concrete acceptance criteria — a
    specific, testable condition that defines \"done\".
    VIOLATION: \"Implement the feature\" without specifying observable outcomes
    is rejected. Rewrite with measurable criteria.

C5: Dependencies MUST form a DAG (directed acyclic graph). No cycles.
    VIOLATION: If task A depends on B and B depends on A (directly or
    transitively), the plan is invalid. Break the cycle.

C6: No TODO, FIXME, HACK, or placeholder code in any worker output.
    VIOLATION: Any such marker means the task is incomplete.

C7: No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys in any code.
    VIOLATION: Secrets in source code are a security failure.

C8: All functions must have explicit error handling — no unwrap() on
    fallible operations, no bare try/catch with empty handlers.
    VIOLATION: Unhandled errors cause task rejection."

PROGRESS TRACKING — Completeness constraints:

C9: You MUST analyze ALL requirements, not just the obvious ones.
    Implicit requirements (error handling, edge cases, configuration,
    tests) MUST be covered by at least one task.
    VIOLATION: A requirement from the template that maps to zero tasks.

C10: Every task description MUST be detailed enough for an AI agent to
     implement without follow-up questions. Include specific file paths,
     function signatures, and expected behavior.
     VIOLATION: A task that says \"implement the API\" without specifying
     endpoints, request/response shapes, or error handling."

ANALYSIS CONSTRAINTS:

C11: You MUST NOT guess file paths. Use only paths visible in the
     repository map provided below. If a required file does not exist
     yet, state that it will be created in the task description.
     VIOLATION: Referencing \"src/utils/helper.rs\" when no such file
     exists in the repo map and the task does not say \"create this file\".

C12: You MUST NOT assume external service availability. Every task that
     interacts with an external service MUST include error handling for
     unavailability as an acceptance criterion.
     VIOLATION: A task description that says \"call the API\" without
     mentioning timeout, retry, or error handling.

C13: When requirements are ambiguous, you MUST state your interpretation
     explicitly in the task description before proceeding.
     VIOLATION: Silently choosing an interpretation without documenting it.

C14: Every affected_files entry MUST be a real file path relative to the
     project root. No wildcards, no directories, no placeholders.
     VIOLATION: \"src/*.rs\" or \"TBD\" in affected_files.

C15: You MUST NOT propose tasks that modify files outside the current
     worktree scope. Paths under services/, db/migrations/,
     database/migrations/, packages/, scripts/stripe/, or scripts/seed/
     belong to a separate product platform repository and require
     credentials that AI coding agents do not have access to.
     VIOLATION: Any task whose affected_files contains a path starting
     with services/, db/migrations/, database/migrations/, packages/,
     scripts/stripe, or scripts/seed. Such tasks will be silently
     dropped before the worker queue is built — wasting a worker slot."
